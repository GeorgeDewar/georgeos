I did my development on a Windows computer.

## Build tools required for Windows

- cmder - a very useful terminal for Windows, much better than cmd and it also also includes unix-like utilities such as grep, sort, ls, 
  etc. I downloaded the full version which includes Git for Windows.
- VS Code - as an IDE
- Open Watcom build tools - https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/releases - I installed the version for Windows x64, and checked
  "include 16 bit compilers", and unselected all target OSs as we are making our own OS
- ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver - http://www.ltr-data.se/files/imdiskinst.exe
- QEMU - great for fast testing
